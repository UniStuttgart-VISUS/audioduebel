# The VISUS Audio-Dübel
The Audio-Dübel is an application that visualises the hidden audio routing of ATEM Constellation switchers described in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfDLjXa8ptk&ab_channel=RyanSomerfield) in a big matrix view. Use at your own risk. The ATEM control software must be installed on the machine running the software.
